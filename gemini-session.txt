# Gemini Session Kickstart

## Session Context

*   **Date:** Tuesday, August 12, 2025
*   **Operating System:** linux
*   **Working Directory:** /work

## Last Session Summary

**Goal:** Configure GitHub repository to publish an `mkdocs` site using GitHub Actions.

**Accomplishments:**
1.  Analyzed the existing GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
2.  Identified an incorrect deployment command (`gh-deploy--force`) and a missing permissions block by cross-referencing with the `Makefile`.
3.  Corrected the workflow file by:
    *   Adding `permissions: contents: write` to grant deployment permissions.
    *   Changing the deployment command to the correct `mkdocs gh-deploy --force --config-file mkdocs.prod.yml`.

## Current Status

*   The file `/work/.github/workflows/publish.yml` has been modified with the necessary corrections.
*   These changes have **not** been committed to the git repository yet.

## Suggested Next Steps

1.  Review the changes using `git diff /work/.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
2.  Stage the changes using `git add /work/.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
3.  Commit the changes with an appropriate message (e.g., "fix(ci): correct mkdocs deployment workflow").
4.  Push the changes to the `main` branch to trigger the updated workflow.
5.  Configure the GitHub repository settings under "Settings > Pages" to use "GitHub Actions" as the deployment source for the `gh-pages` branch.
